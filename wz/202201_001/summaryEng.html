The growth rate of difference is relatively low in the regions with greater difference in financial inclusion development, that is, the degree of difference in the development of different regions has the tendency of convergence; The growth rate of polarization is relatively low in the regions with greater polarization in financial inclusion development, that is, the degree of difference in the development of different regions has the tendency of convergence; the difference between regions is the main source of the overall difference; the changing trend of DER index is caused by the changing trend of alienation. </span></span></p>
